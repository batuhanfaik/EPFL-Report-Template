# EPFL - Unofficial Report/Thesis Template (v1.0.1)

This template aims to adapt TU Delft Report Template to EPFL. Some of the main features:

* **Simplicity First:** A class file that has been reduced by nearly 70% to simplify customization;
* **Effortless:** Many common packages are included to get started immediately;
* **Complete:** Ready-to-go when it comes to document and file structure.

This template works with _pdfLaTeX_, _XeLaTeX_ and _LuaLaTeX_. In order to adhere to the EPFL house style, either _XeLaTeX_ or _LuaLaTeX_ is required, as it supports TrueType and OpenType fonts. _BibLaTeX_ is used for the bibliography with as backend _biber_.
